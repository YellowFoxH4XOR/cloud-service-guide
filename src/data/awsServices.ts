EC2 allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction, enabling you to scale up or down within minutes. EC2 offers over 400 instance types across multiple families: General Purpose (M5, M6i), Compute Optimized (C5, C6i), Memory Optimized (R5, R6i, X1), Storage Optimized (I3, D3), and Accelerated Computing (P4, G4). Each instance type is optimized for specific use cases such as web servers, databases, distributed analytics, high-performance computing, machine learning, and graphics workstations. EC2 provides complete control over your computing resources and runs on Amazon's proven computing environment. It features instance storage options including EBS (network-attached) and instance store (local SSD), multiple pricing models (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot), placement groups for optimized networking, enhanced networking with SR-IOV, and integration with VPC for isolated networking. EC2 instances can be launched in multiple Availability Zones for fault tolerance, and Auto Scaling ensures applications scale automatically based on demand.",

You pay only for the compute time you consume â€“ there is no charge when your code is not running. Lambda supports multiple programming languages including Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, .NET Core, and custom runtimes via Lambda Layers. Functions can be triggered by over 200 AWS services and SaaS applications including S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SNS, SQS, API Gateway, EventBridge, and CloudWatch Events. Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger, scaling precisely with the size of the workload from a few requests per day to thousands per second. The service provides built-in fault tolerance, automatically spreads your code across multiple Availability Zones, and includes features like environment variables, VPC support, dead letter queues, and integration with AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing.",
